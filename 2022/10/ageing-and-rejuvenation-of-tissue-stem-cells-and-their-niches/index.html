      <p>I really love this review because it provides me new inspiring ideas and get me into the field of ageing stem cells quickly. It also has a very clear logic structure.</p>
<p><img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_14-47-16.png" alt="">
Stem cell function is crucial for tissue homeostasis. Their dynamics relies on both the cell itself and its interaction with the local and systemic environment. The review will the topic of ageing and rejuvenation of tissue stem cells and their niches in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>cellular and molecular mechanisms during ageing in different tissues and potential rejuvenation strategies.</li>
<li>the interaction between different cell types, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms between ageing niches and stem cells and the influence of systemic factors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="perspectives-and-remaining-questions">Perspectives and remaining questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Finely map stem cell subpopulations in different tissues in old individuals.</li>
<li>Understanding the mechanisms of clonal expansion during ageing and developing interventions to prevent transformation to cancer.</li>
<li>systematically
identify the immune cells present in stem cell niches and
determine whether their clonal expansion is due to the presence of age-specific antigens.</li>
<li>Identifying transcription factors that could be manipulated to reprogram stem cells into younger ones is a
topic of active investigation.(why can&rsquo;t to achieve this through analyzing scRNA-seq data in younger mice and old mice?)</li>
<li>It will be interesting to determine
whether the three-dimensional chromatin structure,
which is particularly important for stem and progenitor
states105, is affected by ageing.</li>
<li>how the various components of the protein homeostasis machinery (for example, proteasome, lysosome,
autophagy and chaperones) respond to cell–cell interaction and environmental stimuli that are prevalent during
ageing, such as inflammation?</li>
<li>it will be important to compare in a systematic manner how different pathways (protein homeostasis, metabolism, chromatin and transcription factors)
impact stem cells and determine how these pathways
may interact in response to external stimuli to modulate
stem cell ageing and rejuvenation.</li>
<li>Understanding the spatial localization and inflammation status of different stem or progenitor cells within regenerative regions with respect to niche cells will be instrumental to better tease out the paracrine influences on stem cells during ageing.</li>
<li>Dissecting the importance of different cell types (for example, infiltration of immune cells or innervation in the tissues) with regard to the stem cell niche will be a key challenge for unraveling the mechanisms of tissue ageing.</li>
<li>It will be interesting to identify strategies to bypass the sensitivity of stem cells to extrinsic signals from old niches, perhaps by conducting genetic or pharmacological screens in stem cells under conditions where the extrinsic signals are strongly inhibitory to identify genes or pathways whose manipulation renders stem cells insensitive to extrinsic inhibitory signals.</li>
<li>While all such factors have the capacity to affect distal tissues, only a subset has been explored for their impact. Thus, a systematic study of factors that are commonly altered in human serum with ageing and how their absence or presence affects ageing of distal stem cell populations is warranted.</li>
<li>Thus, the role of innervation to modulate stem cells and tissue repair with ageing is relatively unexplored and represents a potential therapeutic opportunity.</li>
<li>what extent does the decline in stem cells and their niches contribute to organ deterioration during ageing.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the role of stem cells in age-related diseases？</li>
<li>Systematically test the role of stem cells in various aspects of tissue function and repair during ageing.</li>
<li>Less is known about the impact of disease mutations on stem cells in muscle and other tissues. A more systematic understanding of the causal role of stem cells in age-related diseases will be a key step for innovative strategies for treatment of these diseases. (BOX 1).</li>
<li>Thus, it will be important to establish which stem cell features might be most critical for tissue ageing, disease and repair and how tissue ageing differs in tissues with and without stem cells.</li>
<li>While the benefits of exercise on health are well known203, less is known about the molecular mediators of those benefits and whether and how those benefits are conferred to stem cell function.</li>
<li>dissect in a systematic manner the beneficial effect of exercise on different tissue stem cells and their progeny.</li>
<li>While dietary restriction and related regimens extend lifespan and healthspan, a key question is whether they have a ‘rejuvenating’ effect and reverse ageing features in already old individuals.</li>
<li>It will be important to test which specific components of the diet are most important for stem cell function.</li>
<li>In the future, it will be important to dissect the role of compounds and metabolites in stem cell and tissue function during ageing, especially as they have therapeutic applications.</li>
<li>Whether the rejuvenating effects of the reprogramming factors could be uncoupled from the dedifferentiating effects has been of great interest for enhancing the function of aged cells226.</li>
<li>Another key question will be to determine how long term the effect of reprogramming factors is in tissue ageing.</li>
<li>. It will be interesting to dissect the mechanisms by which reprogramming factors impact ageing hallmarks.</li>
<li>It will be important to determine the effects of these interventions on different tissue stem cells during ageing.</li>
<li>Identification of additional transcription factors, or other molecules236, involved in ‘reprogramming’ of old ageing features will be a key step in stem cell and tissue rejuvenation.</li>
<li>In the future, it will be important to identify the main molecular pathways underlying these global rejuvenation strategies. It will also be intriguing to determine whether other emerging rejuvenation strategies (for example, microbiota replacement238 or circadian changes) could impact stem cell function.</li>
<li>It will be important to determine which mechanisms have the potential to provide better therapeutic avenues — using stem cell transplantation or manipulating endogenous stem cell pools.</li>
<li>Developing and leveraging new technologies to follow and perturb stem cells will be a key area for future research.
<ol>
<li>longitudinal measurements of stem cell behaviors.</li>
<li>identify in a systematic manner the gene networks involved in functional changes</li>
<li>Identifying age-dependent changes in molecules other than RNAs and proteins</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The logic of introduction are as follows:
<img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_15-12-13.png" alt="">
In our body, many organs have stem cells and their distribution is different. 
<img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_15-13-50.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>CD34: Sialomucin, a glycosylated
transmembrane protein that
is expressed by several stem
cells, notably muscle stem cells
and, in humans, haematopoietic
stem cells.</li>
<li>Fibrogenic state: Fibrogenic state
State characterized by
abnormal deposition of
extracellular matrix proteins
and scarring of the tissue.</li>
<li>DNA methyltransferase 3A
(DNMT3A). Enzyme that adds
methyl groups to cytosines
in DNA.</li>
<li>Inflammatory cytokines
Signaling molecules secreted
from immune cells or other
cell types that promote
inflammation.</li>
<li>ATM
Serine and threonine protein
kinase that is recruited at and
activated by double-strand
breaks in DNA.</li>
<li>ATR: Serine and threonine protein kinase that is activated by single-strand breaks in DNA.</li>
<li>sarcopenia:  an age related, involuntary loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength.</li>
<li>parabiosis — the sharing of blood circulation between two individuals of different ages/</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defects-in-stem-cells-during-ageing">Defects in stem cells during ageing</h2>
<p>They list four types of dysfunction of the ageing stem cells.<br>
<img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_15-31-37.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="reduced-ability-to-produce-committed-progeny">reduced ability to produce committed progeny.</h3>
<p>A main feature of ageing is a reduced ability of somatic stem cells to produce new differentiated cells in organs like brain, muscle, fat, skin and lung. The major technologies used are single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>In brain, the number of activated Neural stem cells decreased with ageing while the timing is still debated.</li>
<li>In blood, old HSCs would generate fewer lymphoid cells and skewed towards the myeloid lineage.</li>
<li>In muscle, old MuSCs has slower kinetics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heterogeneity-of-quiescent-stem-cell-pools-with-ageing">Heterogeneity of quiescent stem cell pools with ageing</h3>
<p>Aged individuals has higher stem cell heterogeneity. 
For example, a subset of NSCs will enter a deeper irreversible quiescence state. (So can we make cancer stem cells sleep forever rather than make them die?). But some subsets seem to be protected from the ageing effect.</p>
<h3 id="abnormal-fate">Abnormal fate</h3>
<p>During ageing, some stem cells may enter quiescent state permanently while others could be abnormally activated. This is usually characterized as a biased progenitors.</p>
<h3 id="summary">summary</h3>
<p>Ageing stem cells may have declined number, more heterogeneity, abnormal fate. We should be aware that these effects are not a monotonous process, they instead reflects the different phases in our life.</p>
<h3 id="somatic-mutations-and-clonal-competition-in-stem-cell-pools-with-ageing">Somatic mutations and clonal competition in stem cell pools with ageing</h3>
<p>Higher heterogeneity usually leads to higher competition among populations because variant stem cells have different survival and proliferative advantage. A relevant process is clonal expansion, which is thought to be a normal process associated with ageing in all tissues. The detailed mechanisms is not clear enough yet.</p>
<h3 id="accumulation-of-ageing-markers">Accumulation of ageing markers</h3>
<p>During ageing, stem cells would accumulate transcriptomic and proteomic changes.</p>
<p>However, an interesting phenomenon is that activated NSCs exhibit fewer transcriptomic changes. This is perhaps because activated NSCs don&rsquo;t have enough time to accumulate changes or changes are diluted. The muscle stem cells exactly the opposite. The reasons why they have such a huge difference is not clear yet.</p>
<p>Consistently, stem cells usually upregulated ECM proteins and genes related to cell adhesion. Upregulation of cell adhesion markers in
HSCs may be a direct indicator of their inflammatory
state and may correlate with the bias towards myeloid
cell production.</p>
<h2 id="defects-in-stem-cell-niches-during-ageing">Defects in stem cell niches during ageing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Age-dependent changes in niche cells during ageing.</li>
<li>The infiltration of different types of immune cells
in stem cell niches.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="age-dependent-changes-in-soluble-factors-and-the-stem-cell-milieu">Age-dependent changes in soluble factors and the stem cell milieu.</h3>
<p>Many solution factors(cytokines, growth factors, metabolites and
nutrients) around the stem cell pools also change significantly during ageing. 
For example the inflammatory cytokines partially caused by infiltrating immune cells.</p>
<h3 id="age-dependent-changes-in-the-biophysical-properties-of-the-niche">Age-dependent changes in the biophysical properties of the niche</h3>
<p>Stem cell niches become stiffer during ageing, and they
exhibit drastic changes in ECM composition. This phenomenon has been observed in tissues like ageing brain, bone marrow, skeletal muscle and skin. This may contribute to stem cell defects mentioned before.</p>
<h2 id="molecular-mechanisms-of-stem-cell-ageing">Molecular mechanisms of stem cell ageing.</h2>
<p>there are three levels of mechanisms.
<img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_16-28-06.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_16-29-13.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="signaling-pathways-and-transcription-factors">Signaling pathways and transcription factors</h3>
<p>They discussed transcription factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOXO transcription factors: it can integrate growth factors and stress signals. But I don&rsquo;t really understand: FOXO factors depletion will cause MuSC depletion over time but their presence will also induce IFN production, are the inflammatory state good for the stem cells?</li>
<li>STAT3: a transcription factor activated by
inflammatory cytokines — is at least in part responsible for NSC differentiation being biased towards glial
cells (rather than neurons) during ageing46,94. STAT3 is
modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine, and this
post-translational modification is lost during ageing,
contributing to the ageing-dependent bias towards glia.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="epigenomic-mechanisms">Epigenomic mechanisms</h3>
<p>Epigenetic modification can alter the chromatin accessibility and ultimately regulate the gene expression. TET2 knockdown has similar effects with ageing and DNMT3A and TET2 are associated with ageing in MuSCs.</p>
<h3 id="protein-homeostasis">Protein homeostasis</h3>
<p>lysosome and autophagy pathways are crucial to regulate protein homeostasis. lysosome clearing decline with ageing, showing increased protein aggregation.</p>
<p>The autophagy is critical to maintain HSCs and MuSC during ageing but the mechanisms are not clear yet.</p>
<p>Other mechanisms like protein chaperones also play a role in this process.</p>
<h3 id="metabolisms">Metabolisms</h3>
<p>This metabolic regulation involves regulation by NAD, ATP, glucose, amino-acids and lipids.</p>
<p>The sirtuin family of NAD-dependent protein
deacetylases plays an important role in connecting metabolic state to stem cell function. Its levels decline with ageing. Both SIRT1 and SIRT2 can help reducing ageing in stem cells.</p>
<p>Glycolysis and mitochondria: their function decline with ageing. Even though aged MuSCs and HSCs have increased glucose use. Knockout of Tfam (a central
transcription factor for mitochondria) mimics ageing
in NSCs.</p>
<p>Other metabolites like fumarate, succinate and α-ketoglutarate and even oxygen levels can also improve stem cells functions.</p>
<h2 id="interactions-within-the-niche">Interactions within the niche</h2>
<p>This part will introduce how the paracrine factors sereted from other stem cells, niche cells, endothelial ceells, immune cells and factors present in the ECM.</p>
<h3 id="produced-by-other-stem-cells-and-niche-cells">Produced by other stem cells and niche cells.</h3>
<p>Paracrine signalings are altered during ageing. This can affect the functino of stem cells. For example, The level of WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 produced by fibroadipogenic progenitors, which are progenies of mesenchymal, will decrease during ageing. This will impair the MuSC function. Therefore, Thus, lack of supporting paracrine factors and enhanced inflammatory signalling from other progenitor/stem cells during ageing can promote the demise of stem cells and the deterioration of the tissue.</p>
<p>Also in the MuSCs, the niche cells skeletal myofibre can send quiescence-promoting signals to the stem cells, but they will produce different signals during ageing.</p>
<h3 id="produced-by-other-lineages">Produced by other lineages</h3>
<p>Endothelial cells or immune cells can also contribute to the stem cell and tissue defects during ageing.</p>
<p>Blood vessel cells are a type of endothelial cells and they can secrete some factors to regulate stem cell proliferation during ageing. Immune cells infiltrate old regenerative niches and can affect stem cells by releasing inflammatory cytokines, including inteferons.(Does this inflammatory state can decrease stem cell proliferation? because they stated that Chronic inflammation and IFNα convert αNSCs into ΩNSCs, which are more quiescent).</p>
<h3 id="ecm-and-biophysical-properties">ECM and biophysical properties</h3>
<p>ECM deposited by different cell types is emerging as a key player in stem cell ageing. There are strong transcriptomic shift of ECM proteins during ageing. For example, during ageing, expression of collagen type XVII α1 chain (COL17A1) decreases owing to genomic stress (UV) in a heterogeneous manner in some epithelial stem cells (epidermal stem cells) but not others.</p>
<p>Importantly, general niche biophysical properties (for example, niche stiffness) are important and can act as a signalling mechanism via mechanosensing. Interestingly, Interestingly, niche stiffness is mediated by the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 in OPCs(It will be interesting to check the expression level of piezo in older individuals).</p>
<h2 id="interaction-across-systems">Interaction across systems</h2>
<p>Next they discuss how stem cells in one tissue are influenced by long-range interactions from other tissues and systems altogether.</p>
<p>Soluble molecules, extracellular vesicles(contain RNA and proteins), innervating neurons, circulating metabolites may all influence the stem cell ageing process.</p>
<h3 id="cirdian-clocks">Cirdian clocks</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Most if not all physiological responses are modulated by circadian clocks, which are mostly entrained by light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Older individuals usually display abnormal circadian clocks, but whether the age-associated changes in clock control can influence stem cell function is not known yet.</p>
<p>Researches have found that Bmal1(also known as Arntl) can prevent premature epithelial differentiation in the skin. The HSCs homeostasis is governed by many clock genes, too.</p>
<h2 id="stem-cells-in-tissue-ageing-and-disease">stem cells in tissue ageing and disease</h2>
<h3 id="forced-depletion-of-stem-cells-in-tissues-and-the-disease">Forced depletion of stem cells in tissues and the disease</h3>
<p>If we force depletion of MuSCs, surprisingly it&rsquo;s not suffient to muscle decline. However,we need to note that in many cases, the genetic manipulation can&rsquo;s fully recapitulate the magnitude and type of the changes that occur with ageing. (The genetic manipulation is stronger).</p>
<p>We can also test the role of stem cell function through transplantation experiment.</p>
<p>Reduced stem cell pools can cause some diseases. For example, age-associated myelodysplastic syndrome is thought to be due to dysfunction of HSCs. And germline mutations in genes of the telomerase complex cause dyskeratosis congenita, a disease characterized by age-associated phenotypes in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, skin and livers.</p>
<h2 id="rejuvenation-strategies-impacting-the-niche">Rejuvenation strategies impacting the niche</h2>
<p>Three interventions have been reported to impact aged stem cell function via systemic signaling: heterochronic parabiosis, exercise and diet (TABLE 1).
<img src="images/Snipaste_2022-10-15_20-14-23.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="heterochronic-parabiosis-and-blood-factors">Heterochronic parabiosis and blood factors</h3>
<p>This type of experiments show that the circulatory factors can indeed impact the stem cell function and Indeed, transfusion of young plasma can partially recapitulate the effects of heterochronic parabiosis on aged tissues and, conversely, the transfusion of aged plasma has suppressive effects on young tissues. Until, some factors that have anti-ageing(or pro-ageing) effect have been effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rejuvenating factors: TIMP2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ageing factors: CXCL11</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neverthelss, we should note that not all stem cell may respond in the same way to the effect of parabiosis(adminitration some factors and they will rejuvenate, looks magical but not every stem cell likes taht).</p>
<h2 id="exercise-and-dietary-restriction">Exercise and dietary restriction</h2>
<p>Exercise is overall benefitial for maintaining stem cells and it results many physiological changes, like increased blood flow, alterations in energy utilization.</p>
<p>Transfer of plasma from exercised mice to non-exercised aged mice enhanced neurogenesis and cognitive function. Exercise may act on this through increasing inhibitors of complement, or increasing blood levels of liver enzyme GPLD1(glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1).</p>
<p>Dietary restrictions have known to delay the ageing proces. For example, intermittent fasting, fasting-mimicking diet(5 days fasting+2 days feeding) can extend life span. The diet will ultimately change the behaviors of many tissues and cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the intestine, ageing is associated with impaired ISC function that can lead to malabsorption syndromes. Dietary restriction followed by refeeding restores aged epithelial function by promoting stem cell differentiation along the secretory lineage.</li>
<li>In aged mice, the fasting-mimicking diet with cycles of fasting and refeeding enhances neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paradoxically, complete fasting is beneficial for ISC functions but in muscle, fasting can impair the regenerative activity of MuSCs,</p>
<h3 id="dietary-restriction-mimetics-and-metabolites">dietary restriction mimetics and metabolites</h3>
<p>Pharmacological compounds or metabolites that mimic dietary restriction) have also been shown to reverse age-related declines in stem cell function209 (TABLE 1). These conpounds include mTOR pathway inhibitors, AMPK activator, siruin activator. However, there are some paradoxical results:</p>
<p>NAD administration on ISCs can reverse the age-associated impairing process but its benefits can be inhibited by mTOR inhibitor.</p>
<h2 id="stem-cell-rejuvenation-partial-reprogramming">Stem cell rejuvenation: partial reprogramming</h2>
<p>Even though cocnditional expression of OSKM factors can result in teratomas, cyclical induction can restore youthful properties youthful properties to aged cells and tissue.</p>
<p>Besides, The beneficial effects of OSKM on muscle function may be not cell autonomous: indeed expression of OSKM in myofibres, but not in MuSCs, promotes regeneration of old muscles.</p>
<p>Other factors may also play a role in this rejuvenation process. In an ex vivo screen, five TFs are identified(KLF7, XBP1), when expressed in niche cells ex vivo, sustain HSC function for subsequent competitive reconstitution assays.</p>
<p>The most imporatnt idea: It is crucial to understand how to balance rejuvenating effects and the risk of triggering tumorigenesis, especially in the case of reprogramming that involves an oncogene (for example, MYC), and young blood that could include factors that favour tumorigenesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some rejuvenation strategies may have only transient benefits or even have negative long-term consequences. One possible explanation for such negative effects is that these rejuvenation interventions activate a pool of stem cells but in so doing deplete this pool prematurely(This explanation I have never thought of before). Thus, it will be essential to understand the mechanisms that control the balance between stem cell rejuvenation and stem cell exhaustion.(This paragraph writes very well so I just pasted here).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should also note that mice and human may not share all the molecualr mechanisms considering their lifespan varied a lot. Therefore, we should also study long-lived species for comparison (for example, comparing the naked mole rat and mice) and human stem cells or even generating stem cell chimaera (mouse–naked mole rat and chimpanzee–human) could shed light on the differences in stem cell maintenance mechanisms between species</p>
<h3 id="stem-cell-therapy">Stem cell therapy</h3>
<p>The barriers of stem cell therapy:</p>
<ol>
<li>proper cell fate and integration in the tissue,</li>
<li>maintenance of the youthful state of stem cells and their progeny in old tissues,</li>
<li>and the absence of tumorigenesis.</li>
</ol>
